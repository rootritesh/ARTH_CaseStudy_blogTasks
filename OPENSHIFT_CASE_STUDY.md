# Openshift Case Study

## Porsche Informatik speeds development with Red Hat OpenShift

Porsche Informatik, IT service provider for the Volkswagen Automotive Group, needed to speed application development and delivery to stay competitive in a fast-paced global market. The organization used Red Hat OpenShift to create a private cloud container environment. Porsche Informatik’s developers can now take advantage of self-service capabilities, and teams across the organization can work together more effectively with a DevOps approach supporting continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) workflows. As a result, Porsche Informatik has cut development time from weeks to hours and created a solid foundation to stay ahead of competition.

### Benefits
* Reduced development times from 5-6 weeks to hours with self-service provisioning
* Established DevOps community for more engaged teamwork
* Gained support for early adoption of Kubernetes and container technology to outpace competition
